  In order to improve brand reputation and satisfy local regulation
  As a Change Manager
  I want customers and authorities to be notified of service affecting changes via MBOSS

  #Test requires us to send a CR with no active service info and someone on the MBOSS side needs to check the CR cannot be found (or maybe someone on OW side to look at outgoing logs and verify its not there)
  Scenario: Change requests with active service information and active CIs should be sent to MBOSS
    Given there is an change request with an active service information
    And there is a CI with an active impact record
    When the MBOSS file automation generates a new file to send to the respective country
    Then the change requests and CIs will be included in those files

  Scenario: Change requests with no active service information should not be sent to MBOSS

  Scenario: Change Requests with a mixture of CIs with active and inactive impact record should only send CIs with active impact records to MBOSS
    Given there is an change request with an active service information
    And there are some CIs with an active impact record
    And there are some CIs with inactive impact records
    When the MBOSS file automation generates a new file to send to the respective country

    And the CIs which have active impact records will be included in those files
    And the CIs which have inactive impact records will not be included in those files
